# 🧠 From Developer to AI Engineer — A Practical Roadmap

> Built by a developer, for developers. Not by an expert — but verified by many.

---

## How This Was Made

I'm not a roadmap expert. But I spent serious time on this —
consulting 5–7 different LLMs, cross-checking outputs, and stress-testing
the structure against other roadmaps in the wild.

**Result:** 90% of the time, this roadmap held up stronger than the alternatives.

So here it is.

---

## Who This Is For

This roadmap is designed for **developers transitioning into AI Engineering** —
specifically the **Applied AI Engineer** path.

You already know how to build software.
This shows you how to layer AI on top of that.

---

## What to Expect

- **You will hit a flow state.** This path is sequenced to build momentum,
  not overwhelm you from day one.
- **This is a direction, not a ceiling.** Branch out as your interests develop.
  Read more. Build more. Go deeper where it excites you.
- **Progress is saved to your device.** No account needed — your checklist
  lives in your browser. Same device, same browser = progress intact.
- **Dark mode & Light mode** supported.

---

## ⚠️ One Honest Note

Before committing to this path, validate it against your own trusted sources —
whether that's an AI tool you trust, a mentor, or an engineer in the field.

**This is a starting point. You own the journey.**
